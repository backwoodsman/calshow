This is a plugin for CMSmadesimple.

It extracts a booking list, such as for a holiday letting property, from a list
stored in either a page or a global block. 

In the source text, each entry has four, pipe-separated fields,
arrival-date|departure-date|name|type.  The source data can be enclosed in <pre> 
</pre> tags to avoid reformatting by accidental use of WYSIWYG editors. 

The tag for inserting the calendar optionally can specify the number of months
to display, and the number to skip forward or backward when using the "next"
and "previous" links.

Arrival and departure dates can be clearly identified using pure css

Full instructions for use are given in admin/lang/en_US/calshow.inc.php (whose 
contents need to be added to admin/lang/en_US/admin.inc.php).
