There is no doubt an "official" way to install "approved" plugins, but I 
think this requires official recognition of the plugin project, and I am
unsure how that is achieved.

Unofficially this should work:

--------------------------------
AS A PLUGIN
    copy 
        plugins/function.calshow.php
	    lib/lang/calshow/en_US.php
	    lib/lang/calshow/ext/*
	to the corresponding places

    Also append the contents of	   
	    admin/lang/en_US/calshow.inc.php 
	to admin/lang/en_US/admin.inc.php
    
	as well as any translations in
	    admin/lang/ext/

These help function files will be overwritten at any upgrade, so an 
alternative strategy is to append them to 
        admin/lang/en_US/local.inc.php
and then simply add 'include "local.inc.php";' at the end of admin.inc.php
(but before the closing '?>' ) after any upgrade.

--------------------------------
AS A UDT
The other way is to install the plugin as a User Defined Tag.  To do this,
strip the <?php ?> tags from the function.calshow.php file and paste it into 
your UDT.  It will be cecessary to insert the definitions from lib/lang/calshow/
and modify the two calls to lang_by_realm(), as described below.  You can 
abandon the help functions from the admin/lang/...inc files or paste them in too.  

To remove dependency on lang_by_realm(), find the code:

	for ($i=1; $i<13; $i++) {
		$months[$i] = lang_by_realm("month$i",'calshow');
	}

delete these three lines and insert this in their place:

	$months = array('0', 'january', 'february', 'march', 'april', 'may', 'june', 'july', 'august', 'september', 'october', 'november', 'december');

Then do the same, replacing this segment

    for ($i=1; $i<8; $i++) {
		$daynames[$i] = lang_by_realm("day_short$i",'calshow');
	}

with this line:

	$daynames = array('mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat', 'sun');

The UDT method is untested, but should work I think.
