HOW TO INSTALL THE 'CALSHOW' PLUGIN
    
	copy 
        plugins/function.calshow.php
	    lib/lang/calshow/en_US.php
	    lib/lang/calshow/ext/*
	to the corresponding places in your cmsms installation

    Also append the contents of	   
	    admin/lang/en_US/calshow.inc.php 
	to admin/lang/en_US/admin.inc.php
    
These help function files will be overwritten at any upgrade, so an 
alternative strategy is to append them to 
        admin/lang/en_US/local.inc.php
(Create this file if it does not exist.)
Then simply add 'include "local.inc.php";' at the end of admin.inc.php
(but before the closing '?>' ).  You will need to redo this after any upgrade, but
you can insert all your local includes in the one file so they are all re-activated 
at once.

NOTE RE: TRANSLATIONS

The translations are handled by the function lang_by_realm(). A limited number of 
translations may exist here for insertion in lib/lang/calshow/ext/, and you can 
add your own language there.  If you do so, please upload a copy so that others 
can use it.

If, for any reason, you need to remove dependency on lang_by_realm(), find the code:

	for ($i=1; $i<13; $i++) {
		$months[$i] = lang_by_realm("month$i",'calshow');
	}

delete these three lines and insert this in their place:

	$months = array('0', 'january', 'february', 'march', 'april', 'may', 'june', 'july', 'august', 'september', 'october', 'november', 'december');

or the equivalent in the language you wish to use.

Then do the same, replacing this segment

    for ($i=1; $i<8; $i++) {
		$daynames[$i] = lang_by_realm("day_short$i",'calshow');
	}

with this line:

	$daynames = array('mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat', 'sun');
